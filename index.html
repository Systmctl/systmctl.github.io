        <h1>  About Me </h1>
        <p>
          ~ Hello! My name is Systmctl. I am an enthusiast of hacking, programming, and cybersecurity, and I created this website as a space to share and organize my learning journey in these fields that I am deeply passionate about. Here, you will find content focused on CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, particularly detailed writeups and walkthroughs, as well as a Knowledge Journal where I will be publishing notes on hacking, programming, security techniques, and other related topics. This platform is intended to serve as a personal study repository, while also being a valuable resource for others who are seeking to learn, deepen their understanding, and grow within the world of technology and information security.
        </p>

        <h1>  About Site </h1>
        <p>
          ~ The site is organized into two main directories: <strong>Writeups</strong> and <strong>Journal</strong>. Below is a brief explanation of each section's purpose:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong># ~ Writeups</strong> is where previously solved CTFs will be published, each explained in detail. This section will be dedicated to writeups and general walkthrough content. Some changes may be made to this section in the future, but nothing that needs to be addressed at the moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong># ~ Journal</strong> is the place where I’ll store notes from my studies. For example, I have some summaries and insights about C/C++ that I’d like to share. This section is essentially meant for posting condensed study notes and related content, in a way that helps both myself and others who are following along.
