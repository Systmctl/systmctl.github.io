        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            ~ Hello! My name is <strong>Systmctl</strong>. I'm an enthusiast of hacking, programming, and cybersecurity. I created this site as a personal space to document and organize my learning journey across these fields that I’m deeply passionate about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here you'll find content focused on CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges - especially detailed writeups and walkthroughs explaining the process, tools, and logic behind each solution. I also maintain a <strong>Journal</strong> section, where I share notes and insights related to security research, development, and technology in general.
          </p>

          <p>
            This platform serves both as a personal knowledge base and a learning resource for others who are exploring or growing in the field of cybersecurity and information technology.

        <h1>About the Site</h1>
          <p>
            ~ The site is divided into two main sections: <strong>Writeups</strong> and <strong>Journal</strong>. Each serves a specific purpose:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong># ~ Writeups</strong>: This section contains writeups of CTF challenges I’ve completed. Each entry aims to explain the reasoning, methodology, and tools used throughout the solving process. While it may evolve in the future, its core goal remains: to document practical problem-solving in infosec.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong># ~ Journal</strong>: This is a technical journal where I log study notes, summaries, and thoughts on various topics - for instance, insights into C/C++, networking, reverse engineering, or exploit development. It’s meant to be concise, practical, and useful both for my own reference and for others who are following along.
